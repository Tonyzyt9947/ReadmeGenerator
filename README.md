# ReadmeGenerator
The aim of this project is to create a quality readme generator with node.js. The application should be able to takes user inputs in terminal/gitbash, and automatically generate a README.md file for the user's project. The readme file contains sections and information on the developer, licenses, project title and description, installation process, usage description, credits and methods of contributions, and tests. Outside of the requirements for this project, some questions (with answers associated with optional sections of readme) are rendered skippable, and some questions are only asked given certain user responses to provide some flexibility in terms of customization to the user.
